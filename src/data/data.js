export const about="Hello! My name is Yichen Liu and I am currently a first year student majoring in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. I am currently focused on building strong fundamental skills in Web Development, and am always seeking to create easy to use software that utilizes technology to its full potential. However, I am eager to  explore new fields of computer science in the future, such as machine learning and human computer interaction, and hope to apply software in fun and creative ways. \n \n In my free time, I like to draw and am currently trying my hand at digital art. I love and appreciate animation, and am always gushing over my favourite works that push the boundaries of the medium. I’m almost always listening to something, and you can find almost every genre and subgenre of rock in my Spotify playlists. You can see what I’m listening to right now in the section below!"
