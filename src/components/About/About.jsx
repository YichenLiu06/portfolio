                                Hello! My name is <span className="text-violet-400">Yichen Liu</span> and I am currently a first year student majoring in <span className="text-violet-400">Computer Science</span> at the <span className="text-violet-400">University of Waterloo</span>. I am currently focused on building strong fundamental skills in <span className="text-violet-400">Web Development</span>, and am always seeking to create easy to use software that utilizes technology to its full potential. However, I am eager to  explore new fields of computer science in the future, such as <span className="text-violet-400">Machine Learning and Human Computer Interaction</span>, and hope to apply software in fun and creative ways.
                                {'\n \n'} 
                                In my free time, I like to draw and am currently trying my hand at digital art. I love and appreciate animation, and am always gushing over my favourite works that push the boundaries of the medium. Iâ€™m almost always listening to something, and you can find almost every genre and subgenre of rock in my Spotify playlists. <span className="text-violet-400">You can see what I'm listening to right now below!</span>
